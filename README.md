# OpenAI GPT-3.5/4 and Node.js Project

## Description

This is my work-in-progress project utilizing OpenAI's GPT-3.5/4 models and Node.js. The goal is to leverage GPT-3.5/4's cutting-edge natural language understanding and generation capabilities, implemented with a Node.js backend. This combination is intended to create a powerful AI tool capable of understanding and generating human-like text.

Please note that this project is still under development and not all features may be fully functional at this stage. I appreciate your patience and interest.

## Tools Used

- **OpenAI's GPT-3.5/4 API:** An advanced language model that uses machine learning to produce human-like text.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, perfect for developing server-side and networking applications.
